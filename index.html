                                        <p>Up to 9.2 percent of children and adolescents are believed to experience some type of phobia.

                                            Untreated common phobias that start at a young age can turn into something more severe (i.e. severe social anxiety) growing up. (Common phobias among kids include fear of heights, closed spaces, darkness and needles (going to the doctor or dentist) and social phobia)
                                            
                                            Kids can end up getting bullied for having social phobia or any phobia. Bullying then will worsen a child’s mental state which can lead to something more serious growing up.
                                            
                                            Phobias can severely affect a person’s well being if the trigger is unavoidable.

                                        <h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
                                        <p>Use VR to simulate Exposure Therapy in a form of an engaging story-based game.

                                            When a user is going to encounter their phobia in real life, VR can be used to place them in a calm place to repress their fear.
                                            
                                            Use VR as an assisting tool for psychologists and psychiatrists to determine the progress of their treatment of their phobia.

                                    <h3>Virtual reality and tactile augmentation in the treatment of spider phobia: a case report</h3>
                                    <p>As seen in the title, this research article focuses on the use of VR to treat arachnophobia. 
                                        The paper first explains that the application of VR is effective to treat fear of heights and flying. 
                                        This is based on previous research done. With this Hoffman and Weghorst argue that VR is a potential 
                                        solution to different types of phobias. This is due to desensitization, when patients are exposed to 
                                        their fears incrementally it reduces the emotional response they have when confronted with their phobia. 
                                        The benefit of using VR is that the therapist or the patient can control the simulation giving them a 
                                        sense of security. For this to be successful, the patient must feel like the simulation is real not cartoony. 
                                        Hoffman and Weghorst go on to test this with people who have spider phobia. After exposing them to spiders 
                                        using VR over time, the patients showed improvements in their everyday life. Patients reported that their 
                                        life got significantly better. They could live their life and have more time to do the things they wanted 
                                        to do because they no longer had obsessive compulsions to avoid their phobia or be vigilant and weary of 
                                        encountering their phobia.

                                    <h3>Virtual reality in the treatment of spider phobia: a controlled study</h3>
                                    <p>In this research article, they also researched the effects of using VR to address 
                                        the phobia of spiders. For this study, even though patients were scared and struggled 
                                        with facing their fears, no one dropped out of the study. The researchers note this as 
                                        valuable because it shows that people are willing to give VR a try to help with their phobia 
                                        and complete their treatment all the way through. From the study, the results show that the 
                                        participants who used VR met the criteria to be clinically improved on their phobia. One thing 
                                        that helped these users feel comfortable in the VR environment facing their fear is the fact 
                                        that they were able to touch their phobia, a spider, without the risk of physical danger. This 
                                        alongside previous research may increase how many people with phobias come out and seek treatment.

                            <h2>About Us</h2>
                            <p>Our project is based upon the premise of alleviating phobias in children. While phobias 
                                can be treated at any age, we think it is best to treat them in the childhood to early 
                                adolescence development stage as we believe that phobia becomes more impactful and severe 
                                once the individual reaches adulthood and going forward from there. Hence, phobias in the 
                                adulthood stage can be much more difficult to treat. More importantly, we want to spread 
                                awareness of the effects of phobias on young children. Phobias may play a crucial part in 
                                how children interact in social situations, academic environments, or even at home. Because 
                                of this, our goal for this is to enable children to live out their lives with minimal or no 
                                interference from their phobias. With that said, we want children to feel they are able to make 
                                progress towards conquering their fears in a fun, interactive, yet surreal experience. By using 
                                modern technology such as virtual reality (VR), we can build infrastructures that invoke compelling 
                                narratives to engage the individual.</p>
