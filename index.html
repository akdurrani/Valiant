                            <h4>Problem</h4>
                            <p>Up to 9.2 percent of children and adolescents are believed to experience some type of phobia.
                                Untreated common phobias that start at a young age can turn into something more severe (i.e. severe social anxiety) growing up. (Common phobias among kids include fear of heights, closed spaces, darkness and needles (going to the doctor or dentist) and social phobia)
                                Kids can end up getting bullied for having social phobia or any phobia. Bullying then will worsen a child’s mental state which can lead to something more serious growing up.
                                Phobias can severely affect a person’s well being if the trigger is unavoidable.

                            <p>Use VR to simulate Exposure Therapy in a form of an engaging story-based game.
                                When a user is going to encounter their phobia in real life, VR can be used to place them in a calm place to repress their fear.
                                Use VR as an assisting tool for psychologists and psychiatrists to determine the progress of their treatment of their phobia.

                                <h3>Story</h3>
                                <p>Valiant is creating a world in which each player is a new student at Valiant Academy,
                                    a school for the heroes of tomorrow. The academy is designed to train, strengthen,
                                    and education children who are gifted with powers to become superheroes and fight their fears.
                                    The game borrows concpets from the japanese animated series, My Hero Academia, and
                                    the US comic book story of X-Men. Both of these stories are focused on a school setting where heroes
                                    are being trained to protect the world. The caveat for our game is that their power that they have
                                    to strengthen, is related to their phobia. The player must rise above their fear to face a villain
                                    threatening to destroy the school so the future can have no heroes at all leaving it defenseless. The
                                    child is the only one that can lead the fight but he must train hard in order to be ready to even face them.

                                <h4>Gameplay</h4>
                                <p>Valiant is set in the real world during this timeline where the player is as a new transfer
                                    student to Valiant Academy. At the academy, the player is taken through different levels of training to
                                    build their superpower. Through this gameplay, the player is faced with their phobia, starting with easier levels.
                                    The phobia that is addressed through this game is acrophobia, the irrational fear of heights. The player will
                                    have the power of flight, they can fly ever so high but to do so they need to improve on their fear of heights.
                                    The player has to go through flight training inorder to advance in school and the storyline. Incrementally the child
                                    will face their fear of heights by going through a series of training sessions. At the end of each training session,
                                    they will report to their teacher how they felt throughout the training. As players move through levels and play more on Valiant, they are rewarded with items and points in the game
                                    as a way to motivate them to continue with their training.</p>

                                    <h3>Virtual reality and tactile augmentation in the treatment of spider phobia: a case report</h3>
                                    <p>As seen in the title, this research article focuses on the use of VR to treat arachnophobia.
                                        The paper first explains that the application of VR is effective to treat fear of heights and flying.
                                        This is based on previous research done. With this Hoffman and Weghorst argue that VR is a potential
                                        solution to different types of phobias. This is due to desensitization, when patients are exposed to
                                        their fears incrementally it reduces the emotional response they have when confronted with their phobia.
                                        The benefit of using VR is that the therapist or the patient can control the simulation giving them a
                                        sense of security. For this to be successful, the patient must feel like the simulation is real not cartoony.
                                        Hoffman and Weghorst go on to test this with people who have spider phobia. After exposing them to spiders
                                        using VR over time, the patients showed improvements in their everyday life. Patients reported that their
                                        life got significantly better. They could live their life and have more time to do the things they wanted
                                        to do because they no longer had obsessive compulsions to avoid their phobia or be vigilant and weary of
                                        encountering their phobia.</p>

                                    <h3>Virtual reality in the treatment of spider phobia: a controlled study</h3>
                                    <p>In this research article, they also researched the effects of using VR to address
                                        the phobia of spiders. For this study, even though patients were scared and struggled
                                        with facing their fears, no one dropped out of the study. The researchers note this as
                                        valuable because it shows that people are willing to give VR a try to help with their phobia
                                        and complete their treatment all the way through. From the study, the results show that the
                                        participants who used VR met the criteria to be clinically improved on their phobia. One thing
                                        that helped these users feel comfortable in the VR environment facing their fear is the fact
                                        that they were able to touch their phobia, a spider, without the risk of physical danger. This
                                        alongside previous research may increase how many people with phobias come out and seek treatment.</p>
